It is the worst day of the year for anyone single and depressed, a cruel reminder of how lonely and miserable you are while everyone else is flaunting their happiness and love. You have to endure the sight of couples holding hands, kissing, exchanging gifts, and posting cheesy photos on social media, pretending that you do not care, that you are fine on your own and that you do not need anyone to make you happy. However, deep down, you know that it is a lie and that you are missing out on something that everyone else seems to have. It is a day when you feel even more isolated and hopeless than usual, with nothing to look forward to, nothing to celebrate, nothing to enjoy. You have to face the harsh reality that you are alone in this world and that you might always be, coping with the pain and emptiness that fill your heart, wondering if anyone will ever love you or if you will ever love yourself. It is a day that should be banned, abolished, or erased from the calendar, only serving to make people like me feel worse about themselves and their lives, a day that I wish would never come again, a day that I hate with every fiber of my being."'>â†“ </button>
